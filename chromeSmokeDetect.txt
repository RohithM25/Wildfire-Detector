To detect smoke using OpenCV in Python, you can use the following steps:
Import the necessary libraries.
Load an image or video.
Convert the image to grayscale.
Apply a threshold to the image to binarize it.
Use a morphology operation to remove small objects from the image.
Find the contours in the image.
Classify the contours as smoke or not smoke.

Code:
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load an image
    image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

    # Convert the image to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Apply a threshold to the image to binarize it
    thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 128, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]

    # Use a morphology operation to remove small objects from the image
    kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8)
    thresh = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)

    # Find the contours in the image
    contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    # Classify the contours as smoke or not smoke
    smoke_contours = []
    for contour in contours:
        # Calculate the area of the contour
        area = cv2.contourArea(contour)

        # If the area is greater than a certain threshold, classify the contour as smoke
        if area > 1000:
            smoke_contours.append(contour)

    # Draw the smoke contours on the image
    cv2.drawContours(image, smoke_contours, -1, (0, 0, 255), 2)

    # Display the image
    cv2.imshow('Smoke Detection', image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
